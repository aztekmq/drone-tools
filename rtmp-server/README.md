## Overview

This project provides a **self-hosted RTMP server** inside a **Docker container** for streaming video directly into **OBS Studio** — without relying on external services like YouTube or Twitch.

Although originally designed with **DJI drone controllers** in mind, this solution is fully compatible with **any drone or device** capable of broadcasting via the **RTMP protocol**.

Built using **NGINX precompiled with the RTMP module** (`tiangolo/nginx-rtmp`), it offers a simple, fast, and fully local streaming experience that works across brands and platforms.

---

## Features

- 🎥 Real-time DJI video streaming to OBS Studio.
- 📦 Fully containerized with Docker.
- 🔒 100% private, local network streaming.
- ⚡ Lightweight and production-ready setup.
- 🛠️ Single-command deployment using Docker Compose.
- 🩺 Built-in Docker **HEALTHCHECK** to monitor container well-being.

## 🔧 Utilities

The `utilities/` folder includes helpful shell scripts that simplify common tasks such as starting, stopping, rebuilding, and configuring the RTMP server.

| Script Name         | Description                                                                                 | Example Usage                |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `start_docker.sh`   | Starts the RTMP Docker container using `docker compose`.                                    | `./utilities/start_docker.sh` |
| `stop_docker.sh`    | Stops the RTMP Docker container gracefully.                                                 | `./utilities/stop_docker.sh`  |
| `clean-docker.sh`   | Stops and removes existing containers, rebuilds the image, and restarts the service.        | `./utilities/clean-docker.sh` |
| `set-ipaddress.sh`  | Prompts the user for the Docker host's public IP or hostname and updates the RTMP URL in `index.html`. | `./utilities/set-ipaddress.sh` |
| `show-files.sh`     | Recursively displays the content of project files, excluding binary files. Useful for audits. | `./utilities/show-files.sh`  |

---

All scripts are executable (`chmod +x *.sh`) and ready to use. Run them from the root of the `rtmp-server` directory for best results.

## 🧪 Testing Container Health

After deployment, quickly confirm the container's well-being:

### Step 1: Check container status

```bash
docker ps
```

✅ Look for `local-nginx-rtmp`.  
Status should be **Up (healthy)**.

Example:

```plaintext
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  STATUS          PORTS
abcd1234       local-nginx-rtmp        Up (healthy)    1935/tcp, 8080/tcp
```

---

### Step 2: Confirm the HTTP server responds

Visit:

```plaintext
http://localhost:8080
```

✅ Should load index page or RTMP stats page.

---

### Step 3: Confirm RTMP ingestion

(Optional)

If you have FFmpeg installed:

```bash
ffmpeg -i rtmp://localhost/live/stream -c copy -f null -
```

✅ If FFmpeg connects, RTMP server is ingesting properly.

## 🩺 About the Built-in HEALTHCHECK

This project has a Docker-native `HEALTHCHECK` inside the `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget --spider --quiet http://localhost:8080/ || exit 1
```

| Field | Meaning |
|:------|:--------|
| `interval=30s` | Check health every 30 seconds |
| `timeout=5s` | 5-second timeout per check |
| `start-period=10s` | Wait 10s after container starts before health checks begin |
| `retries=3` | If 3 failures occur in a row, container becomes **unhealthy** |
| `wget` | Container tries to ping its own webserver at `http://localhost:8080/` |

✅ This ensures **automatic detection** if your RTMP server or NGINX fails inside the container.

---

# 📈 Monitoring Tips

Once the server is running, you can easily **monitor the health and live activity** of your RTMP server using built-in tools:

---

## 🔵 Basic Health Check

- Visit:

  ```plaintext
  http://localhost:8080
  ```

  ✅ If you see the "✅ Local RTMP Server is Running" page, the HTTP service is working properly.

---

## 📡 Live RTMP Stream Dashboard

- Visit:

  ```plaintext
  http://localhost:8080/stat
  ```

  ✅ You will see a **live dashboard** showing all currently active RTMP streams:

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Application | The name of the RTMP application (typically `live`) |
| Stream Name | The stream key (e.g., `stream`) being sent |
| Time (seconds) | How long the stream has been active |

- Refresh the `/stat` page to update live activity.
- When your DJI controller or OBS client is streaming, it will immediately appear here!

---

## 🧪 Advanced: Manual Internal Checks

If needed, you can shell into the container and run quick internal health tests:

```bash
docker exec -it local-nginx-rtmp /bin/sh
```

Inside the container:

| Test | Command | Expected Result |
|:-----|:--------|:----------------|
| Test HTTP Server (port 8080) | `wget --spider --quiet http://localhost:8080` | Silent success (`exit 0`) |
| Test RTMP Server (port 1935) | `nc -zv localhost 1935` | `open` if port is listening |

✅ These manual tests verify your NGINX server and RTMP ingestion are working properly inside the container.

---

# 🚀 Pro Tip

If you ever need to **monitor container health externally**:

```bash
docker ps
```

✅ Look for container `STATUS: Up (healthy)`.  
If the server ever becomes unreachable, Docker will automatically mark it as `unhealthy`.

---

# 📋 Quick Monitoring Checklist

| Monitor | Check |
|:--------|:------|
| HTTP Landing Page | http://localhost:8080 |
| RTMP Sessions | http://localhost:8080/stat |
| Docker Health Status | `docker ps` |
| Internal Services (inside container) | `wget` and `nc` |

---

# 📦 Final Project Monitoring Overview

| Layer | How It's Monitored |
|:------|:------------------|
| Container Running | Docker daemon manages container uptime |
| Service Health | Built-in HEALTHCHECK probes HTTP server |
| Live Stream Monitoring | `/stat` dashboard shows active RTMP streams |
| Manual Debugging | Easy bash commands to verify HTTP/RTMP manually |
